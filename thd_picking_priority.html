        <div class="contentsection">
            <p> Customer orders with multiple items were not being picked efficiently within The Home Depot's fulfillment centers due to lack of visibility of orders within zones and location of picking associated within the building. As a result,

            <p><b>Business Goal</b><br> The business' goal to reduce the time gap between when the first item and the last item within a single customer order would be picked so that they could be packed and shipped faster. This efficiency would
                reduce
                delays in shipping, shipping costs and can ultimately improve the overall customer experience.

            <div class="fourembottom"></div>
            <p><b>User Goal</b><br> The outbound leaders' goal was to be able to get visibility to how many items needs to be picked from which regions within the fulfillment center, see which regions need replenishment, where their pickers
                currently are
                and direct pickers to the right region for picking customer orders.

        <div class="sectiontitle">
            <p>Hypothesis</p>
        </div>

        <div class="contentsection">
            <p>To address this issue, the Supply chain engineering team came up with a new process for picking called Conveyable Flow. This process used a system of conveyor belts within the building that would carry customers orders from various
                storage locations to the packing stations. This required the associates to be present in regions that had a lot of customer order volume. The floor leaders would direct the associates to go to those regions through an internal radio
                network.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="twoemboth"></div>
        <div class="hypothesiscontent">
            <p>By directing associates to the right region within the building depending on the customer order flow, we can ensure all the customer orders will be reaching the packing station on time. We will know this to be true when we see less
                order build-up at the packing stations and an increase in associate-picking rate.

        <div class="contentsection">
            <p>To learn more about the picking process and the people, we traveled to a Fulfillment center in Ohio and conducted interviews with the leaders and supervisors of the building. The interviews gave me an in-depth understanding of
                their
                process
                and pain-points.<br><br> Along with the interviews, I spent time
                shadowing some of the floor
                associates as they were picking customer orders to understand how they receive messages and take action on them. Some of the main findings of the research are:

        <div class="contentsection">
            <p>This app was important because by reducing the delay in the picking and packing process, customer orders could be shipped out faster without any being left behind,
                especially
                in case of orders with multiple items.<br><br>

                With better visibility to the picking tasks by various zones, the floor leaders could make better decisions on where and when to direct their associates to pick customer orders. This also resulted in less traveling for the
                associates, which meant they were less tired and could pick more customer orders, faster.

            <p>During the peak season of 2018, we were able to see a 25% increase in the efficiency of the picking process. The final UI was by no means the best, but in the short time we had to design and deliver, it did the job. This project
                helped me
                learn
                the value
                of
                prioritization and having a clear focus on the MVP while running time-compressed design sprints.
